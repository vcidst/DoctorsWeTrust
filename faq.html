						<legend></legend>
						<div class="tim-typo">
							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>Why is the survey so looooong?!</h4>
							<p>
								We were going for a comprehensive questionnaire that covered anything every kind of potential client would like to know. We know it is time-consuming, but we urge you to think about the value the questions have for others in need of good medical care.
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>The doctor I was going to recommend is already listed on it, so should I bother filling in the form?</h4>
							<p>
								Yes, please still go ahead and fill it out. The more recs, the merrier, and the nicer it is for people looking for reassurance that more than one person is happy with the gynaecologist. Also, your experience isn’t the same as the other person’s so we’d like to hear from you.
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>Who are you guys?</h4>
							<p>
								Just a bunch of twitter friends. Amba floated the idea, and roped in Pavithra, Manish and Richa to help with the initial editing and brainstorming.
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>What made you decide to do something like this?</h4>
							<p>
								We’d been saying we wanted to for a while, and then a recent Ladies Finger article gave us a kick in the pants. Also, this expose. (Content note: obstetric violence)
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>Why isn’t there a list for bad doctors to avoid?</h4>
							<p>
								Because we’re not ready for the enormous wanky drama that is going to cause. (Yet.)
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>Why isn’t there a page for my town?</h4>
							<p>No one recommended someone from there yet. You add ‘em, we page ‘em, baby!
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>How can I help besides submitting information on doctors I’ve visited?</h4>
							<p>Spread the word about this project to as diverse a bunch of gynaec-users as you can? Track down missing info like phone numbers and office hours? Volunteer to translate the survey and responses into another language?
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>I’m a doctor and I don’t like the reviews I’ve got. How can I get you to change what my reviews say?</h4>
							<p>
								Well, the hard way is to get a million Australian $$ in unmarked bills, climb up Vaishno Devi, and send us a carrier pigeon telling us you’ve left the money with the chaiwalla in the red jacket.

								The easy way is by being a good doctor, meeting the criterion on this list, and having clients who want to recommend you. (Boring, we know.)


							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>What if doctors game this and recommend themselves and rope their whole families in to do so?</h4>
							<p>
								See, the extreme length of this survey is our secret deterrent to such shenanigans.

								Actually, we don’t have any defences. However, if you see a rec for a doctor you know doesn’t deserve it, go ahead and fill out the form with your opinion of them, and we’ll see what we can do.


							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>Why are these spreadsheets so ugly and difficult to read?</h4>
							<p>
								Because we all have day-jobs that do not involve spreadsheeting or coding skill-sets, and we wanted to get this out there to you as fast as we possibly could. If we have the energy, the time, and the support, we’ll try to aim for a version 2.0 that has dancing fonts and ceiling cat gifs.
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>Why isn’t the rec I submitted via the form showing up in the spreadsheet?</h4>
							<p>
								Because it doesn’t happen automatically. We have to edit the raw data and manually add it to the appropriate page, and unfortunately, it can take months for us to check in with the spreadsheet and update it. Sorry! It will happen, promise…. Just eventually and not right away.
							</p>

							<h4><span class="tim-note"></span>How do I get in touch with you?</h4>
							<p>As we said above: <a href="mailto:docrecs@gmail.com">send us an email</a>, or talk to us <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbaAzaad&sa=D&ust=1557065075320000">on Twitter</a>, or <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/SL8WLOIqo9&sa=D&ust=1557065075320000">fill out the form.</a></p>

She has never asked me about whether my partner is there, what his view is, etc. She's written extensively about maternal choice and human rights in the context of deliveries, and we've discussed this extensively - so I would generally assume she's open, reasonable and forward-thinking. \n\nI am overweight and have PCOS, and have never been shamed. She did advise weight loss as a general strategy for well-being in an initial consultation, but has not mentioned it or 'needled' me or made me feel like a failure in subsequent follow ups. I found the discussion of the topic sensible - when I asked her for strategy, she advised seeking out a dietician.  \n\nPlease note that she does work within a Christian Missionary hospital and her views on some issues such as abortion may have to do with the place she works in and not her - I don't know as I have not discussed this, but I would advice anyone who is seeking her opinion to be conscious of this. A general note though - I found the patient group at the hospital I visited (CSI) diverse. There are women of all religions, classes and ages."

She is expensive but not judgmental about abortion or sexual activity outside of marriage. A lot of doctors who are allegedly open-minded are also quite bad at their jobs. This doctor will eventually try to fleece you and take you to join her private clinic for PCOS but until then she does a good job. She also is knowledgable about diet and about the woman's body. She is matter of fact about STDs and prescribes a single dose of antibiotics for it. She is good, not great but there is so much crap out there that she is much better than any other doctor I've seen. I wouldn't care so much about someone being judgmental as long as they did a good job in terms of medicine and did not over prescribe antibiotics thus ruining your entire health."

She openly asked me if I was sexually active instead of the usual \"Are you married\" and did not bat an eyelid when I said yes (without being married). I've never felt uncomfortable with her or ever hesitant to ask her questions. She has treated me through my unmarried to married status with the same respect and same high quality of professionalism and medical efficiency. I absolutely love her as my gynecologist and now as my OBGYN (the only one my husband seems to be comfortable around as well)."

Finally having visited a wonderful gynac I discovered through tests that I had PCOS and that I had trouble conceiving. But my doctors were very understanding.
